        <h1>About the Festival of Colors</h1>
            <p> &emsp; Grays Harbor Festival of Colors is the premier kite festival on the west coast.<br/>
                This event is made for kite fliers of all skill levels with special events for kids.<br/>  
                In the past we have had kite fliers coming from as far away as India, Canada<br/> 
                and many of the western United States. We are located in Grays Harbor on the<br/> 
                Washington State central coast.<br/><br/> 
                &emsp; Our festival is always on the first full week-end (Fri.,Sat.and Sun) in June.<br/>
                The 2019 Festival of Colors is scheduled for June 7th, 8th and 9th. Our flying<br/>
                beach is famous for the consistency of the winds and mild temperatures, <br/>
                usually low to mid sixties at the time of the festival. </p>
