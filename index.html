                    <p id="aboutParagraph"> &emsp; Grays Harbor Festival of Colors is the premier kite festival on the west coast.
                        This event is made for kite fliers of all skill levels with special events for kids.  
                        In the past we have had kite fliers coming from as far away as India, Canada, 
                        and many from the western United States. We are located in Grays Harbor on the 
                        Washington State central coast.<br/><br/> 
                        &emsp; Our festival is usually on the first full weekend (Fri, Sat, and Sun) in June.
                         Our flying beach is famous for the consistency of the winds and mild temperatures, 
                        usually low to mid sixties at the time of the festival. Join us for some fair weather and fun times!</p>
